# PayPalMPL Plugin #
---------------------------
This is the PayPal Cordova Plugin for Android and iOS. It provides a way to request PayPal natively from JavaScript. 

It's for PayPal classic library MPL (Mobile Payment Library), not for new PayPal SDK. 

As it's stated by PayPal, new SDK is only available for US currently, not for other country yet.

This plugin was updated for Cordova 3.0.0, and tested with the PayPal MPL iOS 2.0.1/Android 1.5.5.45 SDK.

The SDK can be downloaded from PayPal website, or just clone to get some common used SDK:
